# ACOr-algoritm-validity-checking

It a kind of metaheuristic algorithm, that are used for global optimithation (synthesis) problem.
This prigram was created to test the algorithm validity and compare
with other metaheuristic algorithm (genetic alg., particle swarm optimization algorithm).
The program has primitive console interfece for testing only.
There are a set of bench-test function in the programm.

This algorithm (the program class) will be modefied and applyed in real projects.
