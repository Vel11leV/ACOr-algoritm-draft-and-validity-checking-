# ACOr-algorithm-validity-checking

It is a kind of metaheuristic algorithm, that are used for global optimization (synthesis) problem.
This program was created to test the algorithm validity and compare
with other metaheuristic algorithm (genetic alg., particle swarm optimization algorithm).
The program has primitive console interface for testing only.
There are a set of bench-test function in the program.
Testing on bench test function has shown this algorithm to be at the same level with gen. algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm.
This algorithm (the program class) will be modified and applied in real projects.
