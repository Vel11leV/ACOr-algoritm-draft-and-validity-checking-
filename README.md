# ACOr-algorithm-validity-checking

Ant colony based algorithm for continuous domain.

It is a kind of metaheuristic algorithm, algorithms that are used for global optimization (synthesis) problem.
This program was created to test the algorithm validity and compare
with other metaheuristic algorithm (genetic alg., particle swarm optimization algorithm).
The program has primitive console interface for testing only.
There is a set of bench-test function in the program.
